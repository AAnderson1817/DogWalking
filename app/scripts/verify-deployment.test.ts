 * from a working one until an operator hit it at a client's door.
 *
 * `scripts/verify-deployment.sh` is that assertion. This drives it against a
 * stub that can be broken in each direction, because a verification script is
 * exactly the kind of code that passes for the wrong reason — this repository
 * has shipped a typecheck that checked zero files, a vault verification that
 * verified nothing and a deploy that could skip its own function job. Every
 * case below therefore breaks ONE thing and requires the script to notice.
